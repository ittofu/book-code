= Book Code Sample Project
This project is a collection of Spring sources used to depict certain aspects of the framework.

== Building and Deploying
This is a Gradle multi-module project. The *-practice projects, have tests and pieces left unimplemented so building the full project using:
----
gradle build
----
will fail.

In order to build the full project and skipping tests, build from the root  (`book-code`) directory:
----
gradle build -x test 
----
